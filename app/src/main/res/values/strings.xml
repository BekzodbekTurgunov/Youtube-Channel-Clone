        Hey guys, my name is Bekzodbek and i have created this " BIR KAMI TOLMAGAN DUNYO " project to document
        my learning process by turning the stuff I learn into tutorials and blog posts.
        I try to make my videos clear and easy to understand, but I want to point out that
        i am NOT an experienced developer, but rather a beginner that tries to learn by teaching.
        I only make a video about a topic, after i feel like I completely understand it. I try to not
        teach any outdated or wrong information and I research extensively, before I record a video. I also
        have a website where I write regular blog posts, but they are more about productivity
        and other stuff around programming and working in general. On this page you will also find
        the code to most of my videos, so i would be happy !!!
